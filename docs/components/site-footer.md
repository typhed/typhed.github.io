# SiteFooter

</div>

<div align = "justify">

`SiteFooter` is the site footer. On large screens it is a four column row split 20 / 30 / 30 / 20: the brand lockup, two
columns of navigation (PRODUCTS, RESOURCES), and a Contact column with an email link and a social icon row. Beneath them
sits a bottom bar carrying the copyright, legal entity text, and privacy policy link. The legal entity name ("Debmalya
Pramanik HUF") stays as visible text so it contributes to search relevance.

The footer is where the brand layer hands a visitor off to a product. Links that leave `typhed.com` (a product subdomain,
the blog, the LinkedIn career page) are marked `external` in constants, open in a new tab, and carry a trailing arrow
glyph so the visitor sees the jump coming.

It is a Server Component. The columns, copy, and social links come from
[lib/constants.ts](../../packages/ui/lib/constants.ts), and the colors are pure theme tokens (a faint brand wash over the
card surface) so the footer recolors with both light and dark themes automatically.

## Source And Import

  * **Source**: [packages/ui/components/site-footer.tsx](../../packages/ui/components/site-footer.tsx)
  * **Data**: `CONTACT_EMAIL`, `COPYRIGHT`, `FOOTER_COLUMNS`, `PRIVACY_LINK`, and `SOCIAL_LINKS` from
    [lib/constants.ts](../../packages/ui/lib/constants.ts)
  * **Depends on**: [BrandLockup](brand-lockup.md)

```tsx
import { SiteFooter } from "@typhed/ui/components/site-footer"
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `className` | `string` | `undefined` | Classes merged onto the `<footer>` root. |

## Anatomy

The root is a `<footer>` with a top border and a faint brand-washed surface. It contains two main blocks:

**Top block** (the multi-column grid, `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-10`):

  1. **Brand column** (`sm:col-span-2 lg:col-span-2`, the first 20% track): [BrandLockup](brand-lockup.md) alone (the
     official mark plus wordmark plus "Engineering Tomorrow" tagline, sized `w-48 sm:w-56` and theme-matched via the
     `.dark` class). The column is `flex items-center`, so the lockup sits on the vertical centre of the taller nav
     columns. It carries no link list of its own.
  2. **Two nav columns** (PRODUCTS, RESOURCES, `lg:col-span-3` each, the 30% tracks): each column has a heading (`<h2>`)
     and a `<nav>` list of links from `FOOTER_COLUMNS`. Links are quiet at rest (`text-muted-foreground`) and brighten on
     hover (`hover:text-brand`). An external link gets `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, a trailing
     `ArrowUpRight` glyph (`h-3.5 w-3.5`, `aria-hidden`), and an `sr-only` "(opens in a new tab)" note.
  3. **Contact column** (`lg:col-span-2`, the second 20% track): a heading ("Contact Us"), a `mailto:` link to
     `CONTACT_EMAIL` (styled as nav links), and below it a "Social Connect" subheading with a social icon row.

The `lg:grid-cols-10` track count is what encodes the 20 / 30 / 30 / 20 split: two, three, three, and two of ten equal
tracks. Below `lg` the grid falls back to two columns and then to one, so the split is a large-screen rule only.

**Social icon row**:

  * Nested under a "Social Connect" heading (`<h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground">Social Connect</h3>`),
    which sits in a `<div class="mt-6">` below the email text link.
  * A `<nav aria-label="Social media">` of circular icon buttons, driven by `SOCIAL_LINKS` from constants (excluding the
    `mail` entry, which is shown as a text link above). Today that renders GitHub and LinkedIn.
  * Each icon button: `h-9 w-9 rounded-full` with `border-border`, `bg-background/40`, and `text-muted-foreground` at
    rest; on hover: `border-brand/50` and `text-brand`.
  * Supported icon names: `github`, `linkedin`, `twitter`, `instagram`, `youtube`, `facebook`. To add a network, add an
    entry to `SOCIAL_LINKS` with one of these names - no component code change is needed.

**Bottom bar**:

  * Left: `COPYRIGHT.line1` (the year-stamped copyright, muted) stacked above `COPYRIGHT.line2` (the legal entity,
    muted).
  * Right: the privacy policy link (`PRIVACY_LINK`), same muted-to-brand hover as the nav links.
  * Responsive: column on small screens, row on medium and above.

## Colors And Tokens

See the `usage.footer_surface` block in [colors.yml](../design/colors.yml).

| Element | Token / Class |
| :---: | :---: |
| Root background | `bg-card` with gradient `from-brand/5 to-brand-2/5` (a faint on-brand wash) |
| Top border | `border-border` |
| Bottom bar border | `border-border` |
| Column headings | `text-foreground` (emphasized) |
| Link text (resting) | `text-muted-foreground` |
| Link text (hover) | `hover:text-brand` |
| External link arrow | none of its own; the glyph is `currentColor` and tracks the link text |
| Brand lockup | Baked per-theme artwork (mark, wordmark, tagline); see [BrandLockup](brand-lockup.md) |
| Copyright text | `text-muted-foreground` |
| Social icon button border (resting) | `border-border` |
| Social icon button background (resting) | `bg-background/40` |
| Social icon button icon (resting) | `text-muted-foreground` |
| Social icon button border (hover) | `border-brand/50` |
| Social icon button icon (hover) | `hover:text-brand` |

The gradient layers a subtle brand tint over the card surface without obscuring readability, and tracks both themes
automatically through tokens. No hardcoded hex is used.

## Examples

```tsx
// Typical usage at the bottom of the page.
<SiteFooter />
```

```tsx
// Edit the footer columns in constants, not the component. `external: true`
// is what opens a new tab and adds the trailing arrow.
// lib/constants.ts
export const PRODUCT_LINKS: readonly NavLink[] = [
  { label: "TyPhed Trading", href: "https://trading.typhed.com/", external: true },
  { label: "Products Pricing", href: "#" },
] as const

export const FOOTER_COLUMNS: readonly FooterColumn[] = [
  { heading: "PRODUCTS", links: PRODUCT_LINKS },
  { heading: "RESOURCES", links: RESOURCE_LINKS },
] as const
```

```tsx
// Update contact email in constants.
// lib/constants.ts
export const CONTACT_EMAIL = "pramanik.huf@gmail.com" as const
```

## Accessibility

  * Each nav column has an `aria-label` matching its heading, so screen readers announce the section purpose.
  * The social icon row has `aria-label="Social media"` to label the group.
  * Each social icon button carries `aria-label` and `title` matching its network name, so screen readers announce the
    link.
  * The external link arrow is decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`). What it signals visually is given to screen readers as
    `sr-only` text, "(opens in a new tab)", so a new tab is never a surprise.
  * The brand lockup inside the footer is not wrapped in a link; it is a visual marker of context (already at the
    bottom). Its two images are decorative, with a single `sr-only` label; see [BrandLockup](brand-lockup.md).
  * All links are real text, readable by screen readers and searchable by engines.
  * The legal entity name is visible text in the copyright bar, not an image.
  * External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, a security and privacy safeguard.

## Usage Guidelines

The two middle columns come from `FOOTER_COLUMNS` (PRODUCTS and RESOURCES), the contact email from `CONTACT_EMAIL`, and
the social icons from `SOCIAL_LINKS` in constants. Add product or resource links by editing the arrays behind
`FOOTER_COLUMNS`, and set `external: true` on anything that leaves `typhed.com` so it opens in a new tab and shows the
arrow. Do not edit the footer component to add a link. To add a social network, append an entry to `SOCIAL_LINKS` with a
supported icon name; the footer renders it automatically. The `mail` entry in `SOCIAL_LINKS` is always excluded from the
icon row (shown as a text link instead). The brand column holds the lockup and nothing else: it is the visual anchor of
the row, not a link list. Keep the legal entity line as visible text in the copyright bar. The copyright year updates
automatically through JavaScript (`new Date().getFullYear()`), so no annual maintenance is needed.

## Do's And Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Add product or resource links via `FOOTER_COLUMNS` in constants. | Hardcode nav column links into the footer. |
| Mark off-site destinations with `external: true`. | Send a footer link off-site without it, losing the new tab and the arrow. |
| Keep the brand column to the lockup alone. | Reintroduce a link stack under the lockup. |
| Add social networks via `SOCIAL_LINKS` in constants. | Hardcode social links or icon buttons. |
| Drive the email from `CONTACT_EMAIL`. | Paste an email address into the component. |
| Keep the legal entity as visible text in the copyright bar. | Replace it with a logo or hide it. |
| Use one of the supported icon names (github, linkedin, twitter, instagram, youtube, facebook). | Invent new icon names. |
| Keep `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links. | Open external links without the safe `rel`. |
| Hold the 20 / 30 / 30 / 20 split by editing `col-span` on the ten track grid. | Swap in arbitrary percentage widths. |
| Use the subtle brand gradient over `bg-card`. | Add a dark, opaque background. |
